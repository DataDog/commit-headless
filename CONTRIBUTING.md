# Contributing

Welcome! We're glad you're interested in contributing to `commit-headless`. Before submitting your
first contribution, please read the below guide to reduce the chance of your contribution being
declined.

## New Features

Before starting work on a new feature, please propose your new feature via an issue. This'll give
the maintainers an opportunity to review the proposal and make sure it fits within the goals of the
project.

## Bug Fixes

Bug fixes are always welcome! If you've discovered a bug and know how to fix it, you can go ahead
and just submit a pull request. No need to file an issue for it first, although we recommend that
you take a look at the existing issue list to see if it's been reported already as someone else may
already be working on it.

## Writing Tests

New code, or changes to existing code, should come with a representative set of tests. Not
everything needs to be tested, but the happy paths should be tested. Code should ideally be written
to be testable.

## Running Tests

Using go test: `go test -v .`
